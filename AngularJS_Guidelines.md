# AngularJS Development Guidelines
---
- Use `controllerAs` syntax instead of injecting `$scope` -- only inject `$scope` into controllers when needed e.g. when establishing watchers or listeners
- Avoid unnecessary dependency injections
- Avoid using `$rootScope` variables/events
- Avoid adding to the digest cycle
- Prefer `ng-bind` attribute over `{{}}`
- Use `ng-attr-x="{{vm.myVar}}"`, never `x={{vm.myVar}}`
- Use `ng-cloak` to prevent all remaining flashes of unresolved template
- Use `ng-strict-di` to introduce strict dependency checking
- Prefer `ng-if` over `ng-show`/`ng-hide`
- Use `track by` clause on any `ng-repeat` that undergoes refresh
- Avoid manipulating the DOM outside of directives
- Avoid heavy controllers -- put as much logic in services as possible, especially network logic
- Use promises to get data from services
- Use constructor style for your controller names (e.g. `HomeController`)
- Lay out each file as an IIFE with the `use strict` prologue
- Avoid invoking expensive functions in template expressions -- these are reevaluated frequently
- Never use `$rootScope.$on` in a controller unless accompanied by a corresponding `$scope.$on('$destroy', myListener)`
- Pass scope variables (as well as all other volatile data) by value when building requests
- Use function hoisting and the `main` idiom to organize source
- Use resolver pattern to get data from services
- Structure app as a series of nested components, all the way up to the route templates/views
